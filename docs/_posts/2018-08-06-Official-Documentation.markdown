With great power, comes great responsibility. Likewise, with great code comes great documentation. Now I'm not claiming my code (or documentation) is great, rather it's probably far from it, but at least now we have a dedicated space for **Syn's official documentation!** The documentation was written with the *Sphinx* tool and hosted at ReadTheDocs.

You can find Syn's documentation [!here](https://pysyn.readthedocs.io/en/docs/).
