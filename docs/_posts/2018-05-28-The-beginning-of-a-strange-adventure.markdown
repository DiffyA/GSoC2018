Hello everyone!

My name is Victor De Gouveia. I will be maintaining this blog as I venture through the Google Summer of Code 2018 program. 

To keep it short and give a little bit of information about myself, I am a UK-based computer science student that loves to make things that work, and I have been selected by LEAP in order to carry out the development of a password management app that can be incorporated into their existing codebase.

This blog will serve as a sort of adventurer's journal. I will be making weekly updates regarding the progress of the project. Posts will include things such as the struggles of learning new technologies, any persistent bugs that have given me headaches, as well as personal rants. So be prepared.
 
When time permits, I am hoping to move this blog to a stabler, better looking format. But that is not the goal as of yet, so please bear with me :)

If anybody has any inquiries about anything, please don't hesitate to contact me at vdegou@gmail.com. I'll try to get back to you as soon as possible. 

See you in the posts!

-V.
