Time for a little backstory.

In the last post, I briefly mentioned the name of the password manager: **Syn**. I feel it is important to give a name to your software projects. It makes them a little bit more personal. For instance, I know that this is not *just* a password manager. In fact, I probably won't refer to it as a password manager anymore. From now on, it is just Syn.

Syn is the name of a goddess in Norse mythology, the goddess of truth, doorways, and vigilance. It is said that "she guards the door of the hall, and closes it against those who are unworthy". Now, I'm no theologist, but that sounds pretty majestic. And very fitting of a password management app! Yet another thing other password managers don't have!

-V.
